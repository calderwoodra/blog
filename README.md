# Welcome to my blog
How this blog works:
1. Blog posts are published at <post_name>/README.md
2. Each step of development is published as <post_name>/step_<number>_<step_name>
3. Friends and readers are welcome to open PRs on any post 
4. I follow a writing template/steps outlined in WriteThinkLearn.pdf

Why am I doing it this way?
1. I'm generally a really open person, happy to let others see my failures and stumblings as I learn to blog
2. I think it will be interesting to see a git history of my journey into blogging
3. Markup language has plenty of styling tools, especially nice for coding
4. Github is a nice platform for reading README's and linking to gists

All these posts may be republished in other places (links tbd).
