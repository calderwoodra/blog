Deciding what and how to write

Template for this doc is in WriteThinkLearn.pdf

### Why am I writing this?
I'm writing this because building a functioning rebalancer was effing hard

### Who is the audience
Alpaca users, Hacker News, Finance Heads

### What does the reader know/expect/want
They are technical, know finance things, want to learn more/ read about others approaches

### How can I organize it?
- Define the problem
  - What is the problem
    - we offer funds, users can invest $ amounts into those funds
    - They can deposit money into a fund, withdraw from a fund, and the fund will self-manage/rebalance itself
    - The scope of this article is about how to execute the buy/sell orders, not about consuming or using the signals  
  - Why it's important
    - It's important because a fund that doesn't rebalance properly/in a timely manner, will lose money
