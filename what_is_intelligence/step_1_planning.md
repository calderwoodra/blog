# Planning

Deciding what and how to write

Template for this doc is in WriteThinkLearn.pdf

### Why am I writing this?

I'm writing this because I recently had a conversation with a few close friends about what separates the people I find
intelligent from the people I don't. I'm not sure if I have a good answer, but I'm going to try to figure it out.

### Who is the audience

Hacker news types, friends, people who like to talk and debate hard topics

### What does the reader know/expect/want

The reader might have some opinions of intelligent people in their life and characteristics they share, but they don't
need to.

### How can I organize it?

- Why I'm pondering this problem
- Share my opinion on what defines intelligence
- Give some justification for things that aren't intelligence

### What are the format and style requirements

short, bite-sized, meant to start a conversation

## Drafting
