# What are the qualities of an intelligent person?

I've had a few interesting conversations with close friends recently about what separates intelligent people from
un-intelligent people, and we've formed a few opinions. I'd love to open up the conversation and hear how others think
about intelligence. So everytime I discuss "intelligence" below, I really just mean my subjective perspective, not a
definitive objective or measurable one.

## Qualities of intelligent people

**They're disciplined.** They recognize that mastery of anything requires dedicated and consistent effort, and 
consciously set aside time on a regular basis to make their goals possible.

**They're intrinsically motivated.** For example, to the casual bystander it's usually not possible to tell the
difference between someone in the 5th or 1st percentile of a certain domain. So even though an intelligent person might
enjoy sharing their goals and milestones with friends and others, intrinsic motivation is necessary to be distinguished.

**They're capable of independent thought.** With enough hand-holding, motivation and discipline, even the average can
reach impressive milestones in due time. But those who are able to form new thoughts and (re)discover new ideas on their
own tend to progress, learn and master faster.

## Possible manifestations
- Can push conversations forward in interesting ways, discuss abstract topics
- Can do pretty much anything to an above-average level
- Does impressive things, especially as perceived by others with some mastery in the same domain

## Possible anti-manifestations
- Up to date on all the latest news but really just the headlines
    - discipline and motivation isn't needed - it's many people's jobs to make it as easy for you to stay up to date
    - if you can't ever create and infer new information on the topic (i.e. just rattle off the headlines), you're not
      really adding anything to the conversation, you're not having independent thoughts
- People who reach impressive milestones in an average amount of time
    - My thinking here is that with enough discipline and motivation, anyone can achieve impressive things (like playing
      the violin really well or solving a Rubik's Cube in under 10 seconds), but in order to reach these milestones in
      impressive amounts of time you'll need independent thought
- People who are quick to form opinions without being open to changing them
    - It seems like the natural tendency for most people is to quickly form an opinion, so it follows that taking things
      slow and challenging yourself take discipline and motivation. Of course, if you can't form "new" thoughts on your
      own, it's hard to imagine being able to challenge your existing ones as well.
